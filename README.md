A simple digital sketchpad. 
 - Cells in the grid are filled in by hovering over them with your mouse.
 - Colors can be selected with the bottom buttons, and will not reset/clear the grid.
 - The "Default" button sets the grid to 16x16 cells
 - The "Change Size" button allows the user to decide how many cells will be in each row/column (adjusts cell size);
 - The grid is always the same width/height, and is always a square.


This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, and was used to improve my DOM manipulation skills.
